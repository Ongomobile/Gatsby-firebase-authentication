## How To Use

1. Set up Firebase project

   [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/4/)

2. Set up environment varaibles
   Note that environment variables that need to be available in the browser [have to be prefixed](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/#client-side-javascript) with GATSBY\_ Note there are 2 sets of environment vars 1 for Firebase and 1 for gatsby-firesource plugin see sample .env file

3. Setup [Firebase cloud functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions)
